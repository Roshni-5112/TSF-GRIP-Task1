# Sparks Foundation Internship - Linear Regression Task

Welcome to my submission for the first task of my Sparks Foundation internship! In this task, I have implemented a linear regression model to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours. This project uses supervised machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
The problem statement for this task is to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours. Specifically, we need to answer the question: What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hours a day?

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is provided by The Sparks Foundation. It contains two columns: "Hours" (number of study hours) and "Scores" (percentage obtained by the student).

You can find the dataset here: [student_scores.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv)

## Approach
To solve this problem, I have implemented a simple linear regression model using Python and the scikit-learn library. Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for regression tasks.
